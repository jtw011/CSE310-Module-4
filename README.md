# Overview

 The purpose of this project is to improve my understanding of a cloud database and how to work with them. This is a Weather Dashboard that uses an API from openweather for the information and a google firebase cloud database to save the user preferences.

 To use it, select save preferences, enter your preferences and hit enter. You can view them by selecting "2", view the weather by selecting "3", and exiting the program by selecting  4. 

I wrote this program because I wanted something that would test my capabilities in something I've never worked on before.
